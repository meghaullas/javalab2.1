# javalab2.1
This Java program identifies the top K numbers with the highest frequency in a given array, prioritizing larger numbers when frequencies are tied. It uses a HashMap to count the occurrences of each number and a PriorityQueue(min-heap) to sort them by frequency and value. The program then prints the top K numbers in descending order based on their frequency. The method `findFrequentNumbes` accepts `K` as an input and processes the array to find the most frequent numbers.

# javalab2.2
This Java program, encapsulated in the `ShareTrader` class, calculates the maximum profit a trader can achieve from stock prices in a day, with a restriction of at most two transactions (Buy -> Sell -> Buy -> Sell). The class features a static variable `maxProfit` to store the highest profit and a static method `findMaxProfit`, which takes an array of stock prices and computes the maximum profit. The method divides the array into two parts: one tracking the best profit from a single transaction up to a specific day, and the other from that day onward. The result is the maximum sum of profits from these two parts. The program also includes a `main` method to test the functionality with sample data.
