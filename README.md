# javalab2.1
This Java program identifies the top K numbers with the highest frequency in a given array, prioritizing larger numbers when frequencies are tied. It uses a HashMap to count the occurrences of each number and a PriorityQueue(min-heap) to sort them by frequency and value. The program then prints the top K numbers in descending order based on their frequency. The method `findFrequentNumbes` accepts `K` as an input and processes the array to find the most frequent numbers.
